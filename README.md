# Hospital-Management-System

### Goal of the Project
The main purpose of this project, which was carried out within the scope of the database management systems course, was to simulate the database system of a hospital.
In this context, database tables that a hospital basically needs were developed and these tables could be viewed and changed with a simple form interface.

### About Database
Python scripts were used to populate the database of the hospital management system. Management and integration of the database was achieved with PostgreSQL. The data in the project is completely randomly generated and does not reflect reality.
