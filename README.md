# Hospital-Management-System

### Goal of the Project
The main purpose of this project, which was carried out within the scope of the database management systems course, was to simulate the database system of a hospital.
In this context, database tables that a hospital basically needs were developed and these tables could be viewed and changed with a simple form interface.
